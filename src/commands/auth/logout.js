This command can be called multiple times on the same Adobe IMS context with
out causing any errors. The assumption is that after calling this command
without an error, the Adobe IMS context's access and refresh tokens have been
invalidated and removed from persistent storage. Repeatedly calling this
command will just do nothing.
